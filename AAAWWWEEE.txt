🐛 BUG: Shift creation fails silently - no error in UI, shift not in database
Domain: Shift Management
Related: Timesheet (reconciliation might break)

WHAT'S HAPPENING:
User clicks "Create Shift", UI shows success toast, but shift never appears.

CONSOLE LOG:
POST /api/shifts 500
Error: Unique constraint violation on shifts(shift_date, staff_id)

BUSINESS IMPACT:
Staff don't show up for work. Client coverage missing.

EXPECTED:
Either create shift or show error to user.

VALIDATION RULE:
Check: Are we validating shift_date + staff_id uniqueness BEFORE sending to API?

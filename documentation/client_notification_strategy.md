# Strategic Client Notification Plan: The "Peace of Mind" Journey

This document outlines the strategic email notifications to be sent to clients (care homes) at critical stages of the shift lifecycle. The goal is to build trust, provide proactive communication, and create a premium, reliable experience.

---

### Phase 1: Building Confidence Before the Shift

1.  **The "It's Covered" Confirmation**
    *   **Trigger:** A staff member confirms their attendance for a shift.
    *   **Email Subject:** ✅ Confirmed: [Staff Name] for your shift on [Date]
    *   **Email Body:** "Dear [Client Name], Great news! [Staff Name] has personally confirmed they will be there for the [Role] shift on [Date] at [Time]. We've also sent them the shift details and an automated reminder for the day. You can rest assured your shift is covered."
    *   **Reasoning:** Directly counters the client's fear of a no-show. It transforms uncertainty into assurance and signals a robust internal process.

2.  **The "Ready for Tomorrow" Digest**
    *   **Trigger:** An automated email sent daily around 10:00 AM.
    *   **Email Subject:** Your ACG Staffing Schedule for Tomorrow, [Date]
    *   **Email Body:** A clean summary of all confirmed staff for the next day. "Here is a summary of your scheduled staff for tomorrow. All staff have been sent automated reminders and have confirmed their attendance." Includes a simple table of shifts.
    *   **Reasoning:** Makes the care home manager's life easier with a professional, proactive overview. Reinforces the agency's reliability and organization.

### Phase 2: Real-Time Accountability on the Day

3.  **The "They're Here" Arrival Alert**
    *   **Trigger:** Staff member successfully clocks in.
    *   **Email Subject:** ✅ Arrived & Clocked In: [Staff Name] is on-site.
    *   **Email Body:** "Hi [Client Name], Just to let you know, [Staff Name] has arrived and clocked in for their shift at [Time]. Their GPS location was successfully verified within your site's geofence. Have a great shift!"
    *   **Reasoning:** Enhances the existing notification. The active language ("Arrived & Clocked In") and explicit mention of GPS verification provide a digital audit trail and a powerful sense of accountability.

### Phase 3: Effortless Wrap-up & Lasting Impression

4.  **The "60-Second Approval" Timesheet Request**
    *   **Trigger:** Staff clocks out and the timesheet is ready for approval.
    *   **Email Subject:** Action Required: Approve Timesheet for [Staff Name]
    *   **Email Body:** "Hi [Client Name], [Staff Name] has completed their shift. The timesheet is now ready for your approval.
        *   **Scheduled:** 08:00 - 20:00 (12h)
        *   **Actual (from GPS):** 08:02 - 20:05 (12.05h)
        *   **To approve this timesheet in under 60 seconds, please click here: [Link to Approval Page]**"
    *   **Reasoning:** Uses psychology to encourage prompt action. "Under 60 seconds" lowers the mental barrier. Transparency in showing scheduled vs. actual times builds trust.

5.  **The "How Did We Do?" Gratitude & Feedback Email**
    *   **Trigger:** 24 hours after a shift is marked as 'completed'.
    *   **Email Subject:** How was your experience with [Staff Name]?
    *   **Email Body:** "Hi [Client Name], We hope you had a great experience with [Staff Name] during their shift yesterday. Your feedback is crucial for us...
        *   **If you have 30 seconds, would you be willing to leave a quick rating for [Staff Name]?**
        *   [⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐] *(Clickable stars)*
        *   Thank you for choosing us. We appreciate your partnership."
    *   **Reasoning:** An unexpected, "Amazon-like" touch that shows a commitment to quality. It frames the relationship as a partnership and gathers invaluable data for recognizing high-performing staff.
